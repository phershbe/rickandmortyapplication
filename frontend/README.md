This application uses the Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/).  
I changed it in order to use functional components, so I backed up my original version here.  
Several more features are being added. The backend is being added as well.  
The current challenge is to start storing stuff for a user after login.  
Updated versions will be uploaded later.
